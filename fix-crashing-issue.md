<h1>I'm tired of people asking the same question over and over again so I'm writing a guide on how to fix it.</h1>
- First of you will need to http://setup.roblox.com/version and copy the latest version. At the time of making this guide it was "version-3f8c74d282f8480f".

- Now you will have to open a new tab and copy this URL in it "https://setup.roblox.com/(version)-RobloxApp.zip", you need to replace the (version) with the version you just copied from the version page. Just like this.

- It will start downloading the latest NONE BETA Roblox version.

- Now you will need to press the Windows key on your keyboard and R at the same time, a new window will open called "Run". In here you will have to paste "%localappdata%\Roblox\Versions\".

- Once you have done that an explorer window will open with your installed Roblox version. Find the one that contains the "RobloxPlayerBeta.exe". (It might contain more than one folder depending on if you have Roblox studio installed, just open the one that contains the RobloxPlayerBeta.)

- Now, open the zip file you downloaded and replace the "RobloxPlayerBeta.exe" inside of the Roblox directory with the one inside of the zip file.
